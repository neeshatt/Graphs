            A graph G = (V,E) consists of V, a non empty set of vertices (also known as nodes) and E, a set of edges.
            Each edge has either one
            or two vertices associated with it, called its endpoints. An edge is said to <i><span
                    style="color: skyblue;">connect</i></span> its endpoints. Graphs are structures amounting to a set
            of objects in which some pairs of the objects are in some sense "related". Typically, a graph is depicted in
            diagrammatic form as a set of dots or circles for the vertices, joined by lines or curves for the edges.

                has an empty set
                of vertices
                (and thus an empty set of

                connects two different vertices and where
                no two edges connect the same pair of vertices is called a simple graph.
                <br /> <br />

                edges connecting the same vertices are called multigraphs.
                When there are m different edges associated to the same unordered pair of vertices
                {u, v}, we also say that {u, v} is an edge of multiplicity m. That is, we can think of this set of
                edges as m different copies of an edge {u, v}.

                edge that joins a vertex to itself, also called a self-loop.
                <br />A
                simple graph cannot contain any loops, but a multigraph can contain both multiple edges and loops.

                directed edges (or arcs) E. Each directed edge is associated with an ordered pair of vertices.
                The directed edge associated with the ordered pair (u, v) is said to start at u and end at v.

                A directed graph may contain loops and it may contain multiple directed edges that start and end at the
                same vertices. A directed graph may also contain directed edges that connect vertices u and v in both
                directions; that is, when a digraph contains an edge from u to v, it may also contain one or more edges
                from v to u. For some models we may need a graph where some edges are undirected, while others are
                directed. A graph with both directed and undirected edges is called a mixed graph.

                    The set of all neighbors of a vertex v of G = (V,E), denoted by N(v), is called the

                    N(A) the set of all vertices in G that are adjacent to at least one vertex in A. So, N(A) =
