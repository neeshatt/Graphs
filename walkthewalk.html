                </span></b><br /><br />
            A walk can be defined as a sequence of edges and vertices of a graph. When we have a graph and traverse it,
            then
            that traverse will be known as a walk. In a walk, there can be repeated edges and vertices. The number of
            edges
            which is covered in a walk will be known as the Length of the walk. In a graph, there can be more than one
            walk.
            There are two types of the walk: <br />
            1. Open Walk <br />
            2. Closed Walk <br />

            A walk will be known as an <span style="color: #E89611;">open walk</span> if the vertices at which the walk
            starts and ends are different. That means for an open walk, the starting vertex and ending vertex must be
            different. In an open walk, the length of the walk must be more than 0.
            <br /><br />
            A walk will be known as a <span style="color: #E89611;">closed walk</span> if the
            vertices at which the walk starts and ends
            are identical. That means for a closed walk, the starting vertex and ending vertex must be the same.
            <br /> <br />In case of the open walk and closed walk, the edges and vertices can be repeated.

            A <span style="color: #E89611;">path</span> is a walk such that all nodes are distinct. Let n be a
            nonnegative integer and G an undirected graph.
            A path of length n from u
            to v in G is a sequence of n edges e<sub>1</sub>,â€¦,e<sub>n</sub> of G for which there exists a sequence
            x<sub>0</sub> = u, x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>n-1</sub>, x<sub>n</sub> = v of vertices such that
            e<sub>i</sub> has, for i =
            1, ..., n, the endpoints x<sub>i-1</sub> and x<sub>i</sub>, no vertices may be repeated.
            <br /> A <span style="color: #E89611;">trail</span> is a walk such that all edges are distinct, vertex can
            be repeated.

            A <span style="color: #E89611;">cycle</span> is a path that is closed. Length of a cycle = Number of edges.
            A <span style="color: #E89611;">circuit</span> is a trail that is closed.

            An <span style="color: #E89611;">Euler trail</span> is a trail that visits each node exactly once.

            An undirected graph is called 
            <span style="color: #E89611;">connected</span>
             if there is a path between every pair of distinct
            vertices of the graph. An undirected graph that is not connected is called 
            <span style="color: #E89611;">disconnected</span>. We
            say that we disconnect a graph when we remove vertices or edges, or both, to produce a
            disconnected subgraph.
