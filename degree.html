            The vertices v and w are said to be incident with the edge vw; the edge
            vw is incident with each vertex. Two vertices are adjacent if they are the end
            vertices of an edge; two edges are adjacent if they have a vertex in common.
            <br /><br />
            The degree or valency of a vertex, denoted <b><i>deg v</i></b>, is the number of edges that are incident to
            it, where a loop is counted
            twice. The degree of a graph is the maximum of the degrees of its vertices. If <b><i>deg v</i></b> is an
            even number, then
            v is said to be an even
            vertex; if <b><i>deg v</i></b> is an odd number, vertex v is odd. A vertex of degree 0 is said
            to be isolated.

                Each edge contributes two to the sum of the degrees of the vertices because an edge is incident with
                exactly two (possibly equal) vertices. This means that the sum of the degrees of the vertices
                is twice the number of edges. Let G=(V,E) be an undirected graph with m
                edges. Then, 2m = &#8721<sub>v&#949V</sub> deg(v)<br /> This applies even if multiple edges and loops

                An undirected graph has an even number of vertices of odd degree.
                <br /><span style="color:#E89611"><br />Proof:</span>
                Let V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>2</sub> be the set of vertices of even degree and the set of vertices of odd
                degree,
                respectively, in an undirected graph G = (V, E) with m edges. Then, <br /><br /> 2m =
                &#8721<sub>v&#949V</sub> deg(v) = &#8721<sub>v&#949V<sub>1</sub></sub> deg(v) +
                &#8721<sub>v&#949V<sub>2</sub></sub> deg(v)
                <br /><br />
                Because deg(v) is even for v ∈ V<sub>1</sub>, the first term in the right-hand side of the last equality
                is
                even. Furthermore, the sum of the two terms on the right-hand side of the last equality is even,
                because this sum is 2m. Hence, the second term in the sum is also even. Because all the terms in
                this sum are odd, there must be an even number of such terms. Thus, there are an even number
                of vertices of odd degree.

                When (u,v) is an edge of the graph G with directed edges, u is said to be adjacent to v and v
                is said to be adjacent from u. The vertex u is called the initial vertex of (u,v), and v is called
                the terminal or end vertex of (u,v). The initial vertex and terminal vertex of a loop are the

                In a graph with directed edges the <i><span style="color:#E89611">in-degree</span></i> of a vertex v,

                Because each edge has an initial vertex and a terminal vertex, the sum of the in-degrees and
                the sum of the out-degrees of all vertices in a graph with directed edges are the same. Both of
                these sums are the number of edges in the graph.
