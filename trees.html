            A tree is a connected undirected graph with no simple circuits. Because a tree cannot have a simple circuit,
            a tree
            cannot contain multiple edges or loops. Therefore any tree must be a simple graph. It is a connected acyclic
            graph.

                </span></b><br /><br />
            An undirected graph is a tree if and only if there is a unique simple path between any two of its vertices.
            <br /><br />
            <span style="color:#E89611">Proof:</span>
            If T is a tree, then T is a connected graph with no simple circuits. Let x
            and y be two vertices of T. Because T is connected, there is a
            simple path between x and y. Moreover, this path must be unique, for if there were a second
            such path, the path formed by combining the first path from x to y followed by the path from y
            to x obtained by reversing the order of the second path from x to y would form a circuit. This
            implies, that there is a simple circuit in T, which cannot be. Hence, there is a
            unique simple path between any two vertices of a tree.<br /><br />
            Now assuming that there is a unique simple path between any two vertices of a graph T,
            T is connected, because there is a path between any two of its vertices. Furthermore, T
            can have no simple circuits. To see that this is true, if T had a simple circuit that contained
            the vertices x and y, then there would be two simple paths between x and y, because the simple
            circuit is made up of a simple path from x to y and a second simple path from y to x. Hence, a
            graph with a unique simple path between any two vertices is a tree.<br /><br /><br />

                    <h>Forests:</h>
                </span></b><br /><br />
            Graphs containing no simple circuits that are not necessarily connected are called forests and have the
            property that each of their connected components is a tree. Hence, a disjoint collection of trees is known
            as forest.

                </span></b><br /><br />
            A tree is rooted if it comes with a specified vertex, called the root. Here, one vertex, namely the root, is
            distinguished for all the other vertices. Every edge is directed away from the root. An unrooted tree can be
            turned into a rooted tree by choosing any vertex as the root. Different choices of the root produce
            different rooted trees.

            If v is a vertex in a tree, then, <br />
            the <span style="color:#E89611">parent</span> of v is the unique vertex u such that there
            is a directed edge from u to v. When u is the parent of v, v is called a <span
                style="color:#E89611">child</span> of u.
            Vertices with the same parent are called <span style="color:#E89611">siblings</span>. <br />

            The <span style="color:#E89611">ancestors</span> of a vertex other than the root are the vertices in the
            path from the root to this vertex,
            excluding the vertex itself and including the root (that is, its parent, its parentâ€™s parent, and so
            on, until the root is reached). The <span style="color:#E89611">descendants</span> of a vertex v are those
            vertices that have v as
            an ancestor. A vertex of a rooted tree is called a <span style="color:#E89611">leaf</span> if it has no
            children. Vertices that have
            children are called <span style="color:#E89611">internal vertices</span>. The root is an internal vertex
            unless it is the only vertex
            in the graph, in which case it is a leaf.
