            A rooted tree is called an m-ary tree if every internal vertex has no more than m children.
            The tree is called a full m-ary tree if every internal vertex has exactly m children.

                </span></b><br /><br />
            An m-ary tree with m = 2 is called a binary tree. A binary tree is defined as a tree in which there is
            exactly one vertex of degree two, and each of the remaining vertices is of degree one or three. Since the
            vertex of degree two is distinct from all other vertices, this vertex serves as a root.

            An internal vertex has two children, the first child is called the left child and the second child is called
            the right child. The tree rooted at the left child of a vertex is called the left subtree of this vertex,
            and the tree rooted at the right child of a vertex is called the right subtree of the vertex.

            1. The number of vertices in a full binary tree is always odd. <br />
            2. A binary tree with n vertices has n−1 edges.<br />
            3. i internal vertices contains n = 2i + 1 vertices.<br />
            4. n vertices has i = (n − 1) ∕ 2 internal vertices and l = [n + 1] ∕ 2 leaves <br />

                </span></b><br /><br />
            Binary search tree (BST), also called ordered or sorted binary tree, is a rooted binary tree data
            structure with the key of each internal node being greater than all the keys in the respective node's left
            subtree and less than the ones in its right subtree.

            Each node in a Binary Search Tree has at most two children, a left child and a right child, with the left
            child containing values less than the parent node and the right child containing values greater than the
            parent node.
            <br />
            <br /><br />
            To add a new item to a BST, we first compare it with the keys of vertices already in the tree,
            starting at the root and moving to the left if the item is less than the key of the respective vertex
            (if this vertex has a left child), or moving to the right if the item is greater than the key of the
            respective vertex (if this vertex has a right child). When the item is less than the respective vertex
            and this vertex has no left child, then a new vertex with this item as its key is inserted as a
            new left child. Similarly, when the item is greater than the respective vertex and this vertex has
            no right child, then a new vertex with this item as its key is inserted as a new right child.
