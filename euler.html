            The town of Konigsberg, Prussia was divided into four sections by the branches of the Pregel River.
            <br />These four sections included the two regions on the banks of the Pregel, Kneiphof Island,
            and the region between the two branches of the Pregel.
            In the eighteenth century seven bridges connected these regions.
            The townspeople took long walks through town on Sundays. They wondered whether it was
            possible to start at some location in the town, travel across all the bridges
            once without crossing any bridge twice, and return to the starting point.
            The Swiss mathematician <span style="color:#E89611">Leonhard Euler </span>solved
            this problem. His solution, published in 1736, may be the first use of graph theory.

            Euler proved that the problem has no solution.
            Euler first pointed out that the choice of route inside each land mass is irrelevant
            and that the only important feature of a route is the sequence of bridges crossed.
            This allowed him to reformulate the problem in abstract terms (laying the foundations of
            graph theory), eliminating all features except the list of land masses and the
            bridges connecting them. In modern terms, one replaces each land mass with an abstract
            "vertex" or node, and each bridge with an abstract connection, an "edge",
            which only serves to record which pair of vertices (land masses) is
            connected by that bridge. The resulting mathematical structure is a graph.
            <br /><br />
            Since only the connection information is relevant, the shape of pictorial representations of a graph may be
            distorted in any way, without changing the graph itself. Only the number of edges (possibly zero) between
            each pair of nodes is significant. It does not, for instance, matter whether the edges drawn are straight or
            curved, or whether one node is to the left or right of another.
            <br /><br />
            Next, Euler observed that (except at the endpoints of the walk), whenever one enters a vertex by a bridge,
            one leaves the vertex by a bridge. In other words, during any walk in the graph, the number of times one
            enters a non-terminal vertex equals the number of times one leaves it. Now, if every bridge has been
            traversed exactly once, it follows that, for each land mass (except for the ones chosen for the start and
            finish), the number of bridges touching that land mass must be even (half of them, in the particular
            traversal, will be traversed "toward" the landmass; the other half, "away" from it). However, all four of
            the land masses in the original problem are touched by an odd number of bridges (one is touched by 5
            bridges, and each of the other three is touched by 3). Since, at most, two land masses can serve as the
            endpoints of a walk, the proposition of a walk traversing each bridge once leads to a contradiction.

            An Euler path in G is a simple path containing every edge of G.
            A necessary condition for the path of this desired form is that the graph
            be connected and have exactly zero or two nodes of odd degree.
