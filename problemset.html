                Data Structure and Algorithm is an important part of computer science. Trees and Graphs are two very crucial parts of that subject. You might want to try practicing them while you are at it. These resources page will provide you some questions you can practice as well as guide you to the more advanced route.</p>

                    <p>Binary Trees have four types of traversals. In Order Traversal, Pre Order Traversal, Post Order Traversal and finally Level Order Traversal. You will have to code those traversals on your own.</p>
